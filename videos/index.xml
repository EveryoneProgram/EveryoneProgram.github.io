      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people find the tutorials by themselves work fine. However, some folks
prefer starting with video lectures before tackling the tutorial exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve found the free
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-&#34;&gt;Socratica&lt;/a&gt;
series of lectures to be straightforward and useful. They follow a similar (not exact)
order as the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code examples in these videos generally use large enough fonts that you can
even watch them on your phone, if you have young eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Socratica videos seem to have a science-fiction theme in their
artwork, and the speaker gives the impression that she might be an android.
This, however, gives her an excuse for speaking very clearly and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
