      <description>Everyone has their own learning style and speed. We adapt to yours using online self-paced tutorials. You move as fast or as slowly as you feel comfortable. If you get stuck or have questions, we have coaches to help.
Meetings are held in either Crested Butte or Gunnison, Colorado.
Join Any Time You can join at any time &amp;ndash; we have no official starting date and there is no &amp;ldquo;course schedule.</description>
